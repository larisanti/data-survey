## Project Overview

This project consists of the following main steps:

1. **Data Transformation:** Cleaning and structuring the raw data using Power BI's Power Query. Key transformations included removing unnecessary columns, splitting job titles and programming languages into separate fields, and estimating average salaries based on salary ranges.

2. **Data Visualization:** Creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to highlight key insights from the survey responses.

## Dashboard Highlights

The final dashboard includes the following visualizations:

- **Cards:** Displaying the total number of survey participants and the average age of respondents.

- **Stacked Bar Chart:** Showing average salary by job title, grouped into broader categories.

- **Clustered Column Chart:** Visualizing the count of votes for favorite programming languages, with an additional breakdown by job title.

- **Treemap:** Illustrating the distribution of survey participants by country (only two were Brazilian, unfortunately).

- **Gauge Chart:** Representing levels of satisfaction with salary.

- **Donut Chart:** Highlighting how difficult participants found it to break into the data field.

## Tools Used

- **Microsoft Power BI:** The main tool used for data transformation, modeling, and visualization.
- **Power Query:** Utilized for importing and cleaning the raw data.
- **Microsoft Excel:** Used only to preview the raw data.
